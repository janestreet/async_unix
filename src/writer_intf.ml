module type Writer0 = sig
  (** [Writer] is Async's main API for output to a file descriptor. It is the analog of
      [Core.Out_channel].

      Each writer has an internal buffer, to which [Writer.write*] adds data. Each writer
      uses an Async cooperative thread that makes [write()] system calls to move the data
      from the writer's buffer to an OS buffer via the file descriptor.

      There is no guarantee that the data sync on the other side of the writer can keep up
      with the rate at which you are writing. If it cannot, the OS buffer will fill up and
      the writer's cooperative thread will be unable to send any bytes. In that case,
      calls to [Writer.write*] will grow the writer's buffer without bound, as long as
      your program produces data. One solution to this problem is to call [Writer.flushed]
      and not continue until that becomes determined, which will only happen once the
      bytes in the writer's buffer have been successfully transferred to the OS buffer.
      Another solution is to check [Writer.bytes_to_write] and not produce any more data
      if that is beyond some bound.

      There are two kinds of errors that one can handle with writers. First, a writer can
      be [close]d, which will cause future [write]s (and other operations) to
      synchronously raise an exception. Second, the writer's cooperative thread can fail
      due to a [write()] system call failing. This will cause an exception to be sent to
      the writer's monitor, which will be a child of the monitor in effect when the writer
      is created. One can deal with such asynchronous exceptions in the usual way, by
      handling the stream returned by
      [Monitor.detach_and_get_error_stream (Writer.monitor writer)]. *)

  (** [stdout] and [stderr] are writers for file descriptors 1 and 2. They are lazy
      because we don't want to create them in all programs that happen to link with Async.

      When either [stdout] or [stderr] is created, they both are created. Furthermore, if
      they point to the same inode, then they will be the same writer to [Fd.stdout]. This
      can be confusing, because [fd (force stderr)] will be [Fd.stdout], not [Fd.stderr].
      And subsequent modifications of [Fd.stderr] will have no effect on [Writer.stderr].

      Unfortunately, the sharing is necessary because Async uses OS threads to do
      [write()] syscalls using the writer buffer. When calling a program that redirects
      stdout and stderr to the same file, as in:

      {v
      foo.exe >/tmp/z.file 2>&1
      v}

      if [Writer.stdout] and [Writer.stderr] weren't the same writer, then they could have
      threads simultaneously writing to the same file, which could easily cause data loss. *)

  [@@deriving bin_io, sexp]

  (** [create ?buf_len ?syscall ?buffer_age_limit fd] creates a new writer. The file
      descriptor [fd] should not be in use for writing by anything else.

      By default, a write system call occurs at the end of a cycle in which bytes were
      written. One can supply [~syscall:(`Periodic span)] to get better performance. This
      batches writes together, doing the write system call periodically according to the
      supplied span.

      A writer can asynchronously fail if the underlying write syscall returns an error,
      e.g., [EBADF], [EPIPE], [ECONNRESET], ....

      [buffer_age_limit] specifies how backed up you can get before raising an exception.
      The default is [`Unlimited] for files, and 2 minutes for other kinds of file
      descriptors. You can supply [`Unlimited] to turn off buffer-age checks.

      [raise_when_consumer_leaves] specifies whether the writer should raise an exception
      when the consumer receiving bytes from the writer leaves, i.e., in Unix, the write
      syscall returns [EPIPE] or [ECONNRESET]. If [not raise_when_consumer_leaves], then
      the writer will silently drop all writes after the consumer leaves, and the writer
      will eventually fail with a writer-buffer-older-than error if the application
      remains open long enough.

      [line_ending] determines how [newline] and [write_line] terminate lines by default.
      If [line_ending = Unix] then end of line is ["\n"]; if [line_ending = Dos] then end
      of line is ["\r\n"]. Note that [line_ending = Dos] is not equivalent to opening the
      file in text mode because any "\n" characters being printed by other means (e.g.,
      [write "\n"]) are still written verbatim (in Unix style).

      [time_source] is useful in tests to trigger [buffer_age_limit]-related conditions,
      or simply to have the result of (for example) [flushed_time_ns] agree with your
      test's synthetic time. It is also used to schedule the [`Periodic] syscalls.

      [buf_len] specifies the initial size of the internal buffer. This buffer will be
      automatically resized up if more data is written than the buffer has room for, e.g.
      using the [write*] functions. Note that buffers at least 128 KiB in size will be
      allocated with mmap (see [bigstring_unix_stubs.c]); buffers smaller than that will
      go on the C heap directly, which can cause C heap fragmentation in programs that
      allocate lots of buffers, e.g. RPC servers, possibly resulting in unintuitive higher
      overall program memory usage. *)

  (** [with_file file ~f] opens [file] for writing, creates a writer [t], and runs [f t]
      to obtain a deferred [d]. When [d] becomes determined, the writer is closed. When
      the close completes, the result of [with_file] becomes determined with the value of
      [d].

      There is no need to call [Writer.flushed] to ensure that [with_file] waits for the
      writer to be flushed before closing it. [Writer.close] will already wait for the
      flush.

      [exclusive = true] uses a filesystem lock to try and make sure that the file is not
      modified during a concurrent read or write operation. This is an advisory lock,
      which means that the reader must be cooperating by taking a relevant lock when
      writing (see [Reader.with_file]). This is unrelated and should not be confused with
      the [O_EXCL] flag in [open] systemcall. Note that the implementation uses
      [Unix.lockf], which has known pitfalls. It's recommended that you avoid the
      [exclusive] flag in favor of using a library dedicated to dealing with file locks
      where the pitfalls can be documented in detail. *)

  val fd : t -> Fd.t

  (** [set_fd t fd] sets the [fd] used by [t] for its underlying system calls. It first
      waits until everything being sent to the current [fd] is flushed. Of course, one
      must understand how the writer works and what one is doing to use this. *)
  val set_fd : t -> Fd.t -> unit Deferred.t

  (** [write_gen t a] writes [a] to writer [t], with [length] specifying the number of
      bytes needed and [blit_to_bigstring] blitting [a] directly into the [t]'s buffer. If
      one has a type that has [length] and [blit_to_bigstring] functions, like:

      {[
        module A : sig
          type t
          val length : t -> int
          val blit_to_bigstring : (t, Bigstring.t) Blit.blit
        end
      ]}

      then one can use [write_gen] to implement a custom analog of [Writer.write], like:

      {[
        module Write_a : sig
          val write : ?pos:int -> ?len:int -> A.t -> Writer.t -> unit
        end = struct
          let write ?pos ?len a writer =
            Writer.write_gen
              ~length:A.length
              ~blit_to_bigstring:A.blit_to_bigstring
              ?pos
              ?len
              writer
              a
          ;;
        end
      ]}

      In some cases it may be difficult to write only part of a value:

      {[
        module B : sig
          type t
          val length : t -> int
          val blit_to_bigstring : t -> Bigstring.t -> pos:int -> unit
        end
      ]}

      In these cases, use [write_gen_whole] instead. It never requires writing only part
      of a value, although it is potentially less space-efficient. It may waste portions
      of previously-allocated write buffers if they are too small.

      {[
        module Write_b : sig
          val write : B.t -> Writer.t -> unit
        end = struct
          let write b writer =
            Writer.write_gen_whole
              ~length:B.length
              ~blit_to_bigstring:B.blit_to_bigstring
              writer
              b
          ;;
        end
      ]}

      Note: [write_gen] and [write_gen_whole] give you access to the writer's internal
      buffer. You should not capture it; doing so might lead to errors of the segfault
      kind. *)

    -> ?len:int

      [write_direct] raises if [written < 0 || written > len]. [write_direct] returns
      [Some x], or [None] if the writer is stopped. By using [write_direct] only, one can
      ensure that the writer's internal buffer never grows. Look at the [write_direct]

  (** [with_file_atomic ?temp_file ?perm ?fsync ?replace_special file ~f] creates a writer
      to a temp file, feeds that writer to [f], and when the result of [f] becomes
      determined, atomically moves (using [Unix.rename]) the temp file to [file]. If
      [file] currently exists and is a regular file (see below regarding
      [replace_special]) it will be replaced, even if it is read-only.

      The temp file will be [file] (or [temp_file] if supplied) suffixed by a unique
      random sequence of six characters. The temp file will be removed if an exception is
      raised to the monitor of [f] before the result of [f] becomes determined. However,
      if the program exits for some other reason, the temp file may not be cleaned up; so
      it may be prudent to choose a temp file that can be easily found by cleanup tools.

      If [fsync] is [true], the temp file will be flushed to disk before it takes the
      place of the target file, thus guaranteeing that the target file will always be in a
      sound state, even after a machine crash. Since synchronization is extremely slow,
      this is not the default. Think carefully about the event of machine crashes and
      whether you may need this option!

      If [replace_special] is [false] (the default) an existing special [file] (block or
      character device, socket or FIFO) will not be replaced by a regular file, the
      temporary file is not created and an exception is raised. To explicitly replace an
      existing special [file], [replace_special] must be passed as [true]. Note that if
      [file] exists and is a directory, the rename will fail; if [file] exists and is a
      symbolic link, the link will be replaced, not the target (as per [Unix.rename]).

      We intend for [with_file_atomic] to mimic the behavior of the [open] system call, so
      if [file] does not exist, we will apply the current umask to [perm] (the effective
      permissions become [perm land lnot umask], see [man 2 open]). However, if [file]
      does exist and [perm] is specified, we do something different from [open] system
      call: we override the permission with [perm], ignoring the umask. This means that if
      you create and then immediately overwrite the file with [with_file_atomic ~perm],
      then the umask will be honored the first time and ignored the second time. If [perm]
      is not specified, then any existing file permissions are preserved.

      If [f] closes the writer passed to it, [with_file_atomic] raises and does not create
      [file]. *)

  (** [save_sexp] is a special case of [with_file_atomic] that atomically writes the given
      sexp to the specified file.

      [save_sexp t sexp] writes [sexp] to [t], followed by a newline. To read a file
      produced using [save_sexp], one would typically use [Reader.load_sexp], which deals
      with the additional whitespace and works nicely with converting the sexp to a value. *)

    -> ?hum:bool (** default is [true] *)
    -> string
    -> Sexp.t
    -> unit Deferred.t

  (** [save_sexps] works similarly to [save_sexp], but saves a sequence of sexps instead,
      separated by newlines. There is a corresponding [Reader.load_sexps] for reading back
      in. *)
  val save_sexps
    :  ?temp_file:string

  (** [save_sexps_conv] is like [save_sexps], but converts to sexps internally, one at a
      time. This avoids allocating the list of sexps up front, which can be costly. The
      default values of the parameters are the same as [save_sexps]. *)

  (** [save_bin_prot t bin_writer 'a] is a special case of [with_file_atomic] that writes
      ['a] to [t] using its bin_writer, in the size-prefixed format, like
      [write_bin_prot]. To read a file produced using [save_bin_prot], one would typically
      use [Reader.load_bin_prot]. *)
  val save_bin_prot
    :  ?temp_file:string

  (** [transfer' t pipe_r f] repeatedly reads values from [pipe_r] and feeds them to [f],
      which should in turn write them to [t]. It provides pushback to [pipe_r] by not
      reading when [t] cannot keep up with the data being pushed in.

      By default, each read from [pipe_r] reads all the values in [pipe_r]. One can supply
      [max_num_values_per_read] to limit the number of values per read.

      The [transfer'] stops and the result becomes determined when [stop] becomes
      determined, when [pipe_r] reaches its EOF, when [t] is closed, or when [t]'s
      consumer leaves. In the latter two cases, [transfer'] closes [pipe_r].

      [transfer'] causes [Pipe.flushed] on [pipe_r]'s writer to ensure that the bytes have
      been flushed to [t] before returning. It also waits on [Pipe.upstream_flushed] at
      shutdown.

      [transfer t pipe_r f] is equivalent to:

      {[
        transfer' t pipe_r (fun q ->
          Queue.iter q ~f;
          return ())
      ]} *)

  (** [behave_nicely_in_pipeline ~writers ()] causes the program to exit with status 141
      (indicating SIGPIPE) on the next attempt to write if any of the consumers of
      [writers] go away. It also sets the buffer age to unlimited, in case there is a
      human (e.g., using [less]) on the other side of the pipeline.

      This can be called at the toplevel of a program, before [Command.run] for instance.

      then mutates [t] so that all future writes to [t] synchronously call
      [Out_channel.output*] functions to send data to the OS immediately.

      [set_synchronous_out_channel] is used by expect tests to ensure that the
      interleaving between calls to [Core.printf] (and similar IO functions) and
      [Async.printf] generates output with the same interleaving.
      [set_synchronous_out_channel] is idempotent. *)

  (** [use_synchronous_stdout_and_stderr ()] causes all subsequent writes to stdout and
      stderr to occur synchronously (after any pending writes have flushed).

      This ensures [printf]-family writes happen immediately, which avoids two common
      sources of confusion:

      - unexpected interleaving of [Core.printf] and [Async.printf] calls; and
      - [Async.printf] calls that don't get flushed before an application exits

      The disadvantages are:

      - this makes writes blocking, which can delay unrelated asynchronous jobs until the
        consumer stops pushing back; and
      - the errors raised by write are different and it won't respect
        {!behave_nicely_in_pipeline} anymore *)
