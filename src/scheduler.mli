(** Dispatches and monitors Async processes.

    The threading model is as follows. Only one thread runs Async code at a time. This is
    enforced by a single lock in Async's scheduler data structure. There are any number of
    threads running code without holding the lock that get data from the outside world and
    want to affect the Async world. They do this by calling [Thread_safe.run_in_async*],
    which acquires the lock, does a computation (e.g., fills an ivar), and then runs a
    "cycle" of Async computations. *)

(** [max_num_open_file_descrs] is the min of [Config.max_num_open_file_descrs] and the
    current soft FD limit for this process [ulimit -s -n]. The soft limit can be changed
    via [setrlimit] or [Core_unix.RLimit], so this value isn't necessarily constant. *)

val max_num_threads : unit -> int

(** [go ?raise_unhandled_exn ()] passes control to Async, at which point Async starts
    running handlers, one by one without interruption, until there are no more handlers to
    run. When Async is out of handlers, it blocks until the outside world schedules more
    of them. Because of this, Async programs do not exit until [shutdown] is called.

    [go ()] calls [handle_signal Sys.sigpipe], which causes the SIGPIPE signal to be
    ignored. Low-level syscalls (e.g., write) still raise EPIPE.

    If any Async job raises an unhandled exception that is not handled by any monitor,
    Async execution ceases. Then, by default, Async pretty prints the exception, and exits
    with status 1. If you don't want this, pass [~raise_unhandled_exn:true], which will
    cause the unhandled exception to be raised to the caller of [go ()]. *)

(** [go_main] is like [go], except that you supply a [main] function that will be run to
    initialize the Async computation, and that [go_main] will fail if any Async has been
    used prior to [go_main] being called. Moreover it allows you to configure more static
    options of the scheduler. *)

(** [raise_if_any_jobs_were_scheduled ()] will raise an exception if any async work has
    ever been scheduled. This is intended to be called before a program starts, for
    instance before {!Command.run}, to ensure that no libraries have started async work.
    This can happen by mistake (by calling a deferred function at toplevel), which can
    make the behavior of the program unexpectedly non-deterministic. *)
val raise_if_any_jobs_were_scheduled : unit -> unit

(** [report_long_cycle_times ?cutoff ()] sets up something that will print a warning to

(** [set_check_invariants do_check] sets whether Async should check invariants of its
    internal data structures. [set_check_invariants true] can substantially slow down your
    program. *)
val set_check_invariants : bool -> unit

(** [set_detect_invalid_access_from_thread do_check] sets whether Async routines should
    check if they are being accessed from some thread other than the thread currently
    holding the Async lock, which is not allowed and can lead to very confusing behavior. *)
val set_detect_invalid_access_from_thread : bool -> unit

type 'b folder = { folder : 'a. 'b -> t -> (t, 'a) Field.t -> 'b }

(** [fold_fields ~init folder] folds [folder] over each field in the scheduler. The fields
    themselves are not exposed -- [folder] must be a polymorphic function that can work on
    any field. So, it's only useful for generic operations, e.g., getting the size of each
    field. *)

(** If a process that has already created, but not started, the Async scheduler would like
    to fork, and would like the child to have a clean Async, i.e., not inherit any of the
    Async work that was done in the parent, it can call [reset_in_forked_process] at the
    start of execution in the child process. After that, the child can do Async stuff and
    then start the Async scheduler.

    [reset_in_forked_process ()] is a no-op if [is_initialized () = false] and has
    undefined behavior if [is_running () = true]. *)
val reset_in_forked_process : unit -> unit

(** [reset_in_forked_process_without_taking_lock] is similar to [reset_in_forked_process],
    with the difference that async lock is not taken by the calling thread. This means
    it's not safe to do Async stuff unless you obtain the lock first, usually by calling
    functions from the [Thread_safe] module. *)
val reset_in_forked_process_without_taking_lock : unit -> unit

(** [make_async_unusable ()] makes subsequent attempts to use the Async scheduler raise.
    One use case for [make_async_unusable] is if you fork from a process already running
    the Async scheduler, and want to run non-Async OCaml code in the child process, with
    the guarantee that the child process does not use Async. *)
val make_async_unusable : unit -> unit

(** [handle_thread_pool_stuck f] causes [f] to run whenever Async detects its thread pool
    is stuck (i.e., hasn't completed a job for over a second and has work waiting to
    start). Async checks every second. By default, if the thread pool has been stuck for
    less than 60s, Async will [eprintf] a message. If more than 60s, Async will send an
    exception to the main monitor, which will abort the program unless there is a custom
    handler for the main monitor.

    Calling [handle_thread_pool_stuck] replaces whatever behavior was previously there. *)

    spent in calls to [epoll_wait] (or [select]) since the start of the program. *)
val time_spent_waiting_for_io : unit -> Time_ns.Span.t

(** [set_min_inter_cycle_timeout] sets the minimum timeout that the scheduler will pass to
    the OS when it checks for I/O between cycles. The minimum is zero by default. Setting
    it to a nonzero value is used to increase thread fairness between the scheduler and
    other threads. A plausible setting is 10us. This can also be set via the
    [ASYNC_CONFIG] environment variable. *)
val set_min_inter_cycle_timeout : Time_ns.Span.t -> unit

(** Returns true if any user-created fds are registered with the file descriptor watcher.

    The intended use case for this function (together with
    [thread_pool_has_unfinished_work]) is approximate deadlock detection, so that a test
    can crash when it runs out of things to do. *)
val fds_may_produce_events : unit -> bool

(** Returns true if any of the threads in the thread pool are in use. Note that this value
    can change from [true] to [false] "suddenly" (from a separate thread) when a thread
    pool thread finishes.

    However, the work items submitted to the thread pool by [In_thread.run] enqueue their
    result as an [external_job] before finishing.

    So if you observe [thread_pool_has_unfinished_work () = false] and then confirm that
    there are no external jobs in the scheduler, then you know you didn't miss any thead
    pool work. *)
val thread_pool_has_unfinished_work : unit -> bool

(** If any busy pollers exist, they will be called in a busy loop whenever the scheduler
    is waiting on I/O before an Async cycle, with the guarantee that they will be called
    at least once before every Async cycle.

    While the busy loop is running the program will only be responsive to the events
    detected by the pollers and to timing wheel alarms, but won't be responsive to
    anything else (signals, fd events, thread interruptions).

    We do not allow the busy loop to run longer than [max_inter_cycle_timeout]. After
    adding the new busy poller, this function sets the [max_inter_cycle_timeout] to
    [Time_ns.Span.min max_inter_cycle_timeout max_busy_wait_duration].

    The pollers will run with the async lock held, so it's OK to access Async data
    structures, in particular to schedule jobs and alarms.

(** Instead of calling Scheduler.go, the [External] module can be used to drive Async with
    an external loop, manually running regular Async cycles. This is useful to integrate
    Async with another event loop system. *)

      Whether this function may block is controlled by the [max_wait] parameter. Note that
      e.g. [run_one_cycle ~max_wait:(`Until t)] may return:

      - before [t], if something occurs that wakes up Async, such as activity on a file
        descriptor, a timeout occurring, or reaching [max_inter_cycle_timeout]

      - after [t], if there are Async jobs to run and some of them take a long time. That
        is, [max_wait] only controls the time spent blocking, not the time spent running
        jobs.
